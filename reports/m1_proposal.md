## Research Questions & Usage Scenarios

### Usage scenario

Dr. Elena Ramirez is an urban economics professor and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research focuses on understanding patterns in California’s housing market during the late 20th century. She is interested in examining how economic and geographic factors — such as median income, proximity to the ocean, housing age, and housing density — were associated with property values in 1990.

She uses the California Housing 1990 Dashboard to explore a geographic overview of median house values across the state. Through an interactive map, she identifies clusters of high and low value regions. She then examines scatter plots comparing median house value with median income and housing median age to evaluate which factors appear most strongly associated with price. Using bar charts, she compares housing values across ocean proximity categories and across structural characteristics such as total rooms and number of households per block.

By interactively exploring these variables, Dr. Ramirez can better understand the drivers of housing value in 1990 California. Her findings may contribute to broader discussions on long-term housing affordability, regional disparities, and the economic geography of the state.

### User stories

**User story 1:** As an urban economics researcher, I want to analyze the relationship between median income and median house value in order to determine whether higher income areas were associated with higher property prices in 1990.

**User story 2:** As an urban economics researcher, I want to compare median house values across ocean proximity categories in order to assess whether coastal access was associated with higher property values in 1990.

**User story 3:** As an urban economics researcher, I want to visualize the geographic distribution of house values across California to identify spatial clusters of high and low value regions.
