This is a data dashboard project that enables investigation of California housing data from 1990 in an early development stage. We intend to include visualizations such as an interactive map to investigate house prices and features by location. We also plan to include scatter plots to investigate house prices by the age of the house, median income of the households on the same block, proximity to the ocean, and bar plots to investigate house prices by number of bedrooms, number of total rooms, the number of households on the block etc.
